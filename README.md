# Python
 - Py Me Up, Charlie


PyBank



In this challenge, I am tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of the company. I will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)


My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


The total number of months included in the dataset


The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes


The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period




As an example, my analysis should look similar to the one below:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578
Average  Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)




In addition, my final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.



PyPoll



In this section, I am tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.


I will be giving a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:


The total number of votes cast


A complete list of candidates who received votes


The percentage of votes each candidate won


The total number of votes each candidate won


The winner of the election is based on the popular vote.




As an example, my analysis should look similar to the one below:

Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 3521001
-------------------------
Khan: 63.000% (2218231)
Correy: 20.000% (704200)
Li: 14.000% (492940)
O'Tooley: 3.000% (105630)
-------------------------
Winner: Khan
-------------------------



In addition, my final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
